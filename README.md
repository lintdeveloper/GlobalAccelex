### Architecture

The project uses MVVM architecture MV-VM which is a is a software architectural pattern which facilitates separation of development UI (Activity or Fragment) from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model), which is ideal for small to medium sized projects. 

The following is the major components folders/files of my project
1) /view-model - This is my view model, which interacts directly with the UI and also with the network service
2) /models - This contains my model classes
3) /repository - This contains my repository classes to lookup BIN
4) /views - This contains my views/Activity files
4. /services - This initiates a direct communication with the webservice

Others include:
/common
/utils 

### Libraries used 
The Following is list of major libraries used in app.
1) Kotlin Coroutine - Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that converts async callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.  The pattern of async and await in other languages is based on coroutines in Kotlin. [Learn More](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html#sample-projects)
2) Retrofit for web Service Requests - Retrofit is type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc. It is an open source library which simplifies HTTP communication by turning remote APIs into declarative, type-safe interfaces. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. It automatically serializes the JSON response using a POJO which must be defined in advance for the JSON Structure.

3) OkHttp3 Logging Interceptor - An OkHttp interceptor which logs request and response information. Can be applied to web requests in an application. [Read More](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
